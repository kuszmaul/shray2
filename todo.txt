1. nbody with Shray is much faster than Fortran or OpenShmem. That makes no sense either.
   A month back this was not yet the case?! The Fortran or OpenShmem code was not changed
   since then.

2. When it does not prefetch due to a too small cache, it is faster

But this is probably due to the poor prefetching.
