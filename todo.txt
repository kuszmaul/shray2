1. The output of mpirun -n 4 bin/matrix_profile 4000

is

Time 1.311056, 97.631222 Gflops/s
Shray report P(1): 67 segfaults, 6 barriers, 274432 bytes communicated.
Shray report P(2): 67 segfaults, 6 barriers, 274432 bytes communicated.

Shray report P(0): 3 segfaults, 6 barriers, 12288 bytes communicated.

It should only segfault p - 1 times, so why does it segfault more often for P(1), P(2), P(3)?

2. nbody with Shray is much faster than Fortran or OpenShmem. That makes no sense either.
   A month back this was not yet the case?! The Fortran or OpenShmem code was not changed
   since then.

3. After refactoring bin/matrix_profile is slower
