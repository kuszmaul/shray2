Installation using GNU make
===========================

Make sure you have installed GASNet.
Edit config.mk to match your system.

$ make clean install

If your installation directory is not a standard system location, make sure that
$PREFIX/lib is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_RUN_PATH, and that
$PREFIX/include is in CPATH.

Usage
=====

Build your program with a C compiler and link with -lshray
Define preprocessor macro PROFILE for profiling information or DEBUG for
debugging information.


Example program
===============

This program allocates an m x n array and increments its (garbage)
values by one.

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <shray.h>

void arr_inc(size_t m, size_t n, double (*x)[n]) {
    for (size_t i = ShrayStart(x); i < ShrayEnd(x); i++) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            x[i][j]++;
        }
    }
    ShraySync(x);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ShrayInit(&argc, &argv);

  size_t m = 1000;
  size_t n = 2000;
  double (*x)[n] = ShrayMalloc(m,
            m * n * sizeof(double));

  arr_inc(m, n, x);

  ShrayFree(x);
  ShrayFinalize(0);
}
